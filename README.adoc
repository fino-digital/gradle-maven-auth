= Maven Repository Auth Plugin

Gradle plugin used to apply credential information defined in Maven config files to Maven repositories
used in Gradle builds - both for upload and download

== Applying plugin

See https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.hibernate.build.maven-repo-auth for details on how to
apply the plugin.

Applying the plugin does a number of things:

* Creates an extension object `org.hibernate.build.publish.auth.maven.MavenRepoAuthExtension` and makes it available
as `mavenRepoAuth` for configuration of the plugin behavior.  At the moment it just exposes the list of
credential providers.  Projects could theoretically add additional credential providers, but such use is not
supported
* Finds all maven repository definitions in the project and applies the "matching" credentials.  A match
is determined based on the name used in the Gradle build and the server id in the Maven config


== Examples

Let's assume we use a Maven repository located at the URL `http://repository.average.joes.com` and that this repo
is password protected.  Our Maven `settings.xml` file contains:

```
    <settings>
        <servers>
            <server>
                <id>dogdeball-repo</id>
                <username>average-joes</username>
                <password>dodgethis</password>
             </server>
        </servers>
    </settings>
```

=== Downloads

To download artifacts from the repository, we configure it in the Gradle build like so:

```
repositories {
    maven {
        name = 'dogdeball-repo'
        url 'http://repository.average.joes.com'
    }
}
```

Because the name applied to the repo in the Gradle build matches the id of the server as configured in
the Maven `settings.xml` the plugin will apply the credentials from the Maven settings


=== Uploads (legacy publishing)

The plugin can also apply the credentials when the legacy approach of publishing via an Upload task available
through Gradle's MavenPlugin.  E.g.:

```
    uploadArchives {
        repositories.mavenDeployer {
            ...
            repository(id: 'dogdeball-repo', url: 'http://repository.average.joes.com')
        }
    }
```

Again, because the repo-name / server-id match, the credentials will be applied.


=== Publishing

Gradle also defines a proper DSL for "publications", which is also supported by the plugin:

```
    publishing {
        repositories {
            maven {
                name = 'dogdeball-repo'
                url 'http://repository.average.joes.com'
            }
        }
    }
```

=== Limitations

The plugin does not yet work with buildscript repositories.  In the following case, the credentials will
not get applied:

```
    buildscript {
        repositories {
            maven {
                name = 'dogdeball-repo'
                url 'http://repository.average.joes.com'
            }
        }
    }
```

=== Gradle Wrapper

To upgrade Gradle Wrapper to a new version, run:

```sh
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version NEW_VERSION --distribution-type=all
```
